</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>After thinking about starting a blog for a few years but not actually taking any steps toward it, I was inspired to finally give it a try by <a href="https://testandcode.com/191">this</a> episode in one of my favorite podcasts. One of the things that they discuss is that there are many reasons to have a blog and many ways of blogging, which spoke to me because one of my major hesitations was that I don't have a very focused topic and I don't want to go after any particular audience. My intention for this blog is to be a spot where I can keep notes about things I want to remember, projects, and useful tips &amp; tricks. </p>
<p>I used the project setup and static file publishing steps from <a href="https://justinnaldzin.github.io/create-a-website-using-github-pages-and-pelican.html">this Pelican tutorial</a>. I didn't use the theme section or the Jupyter Notebook section because neither worked quite right for me (and I like the default theme). I didn't look into the theme support enough to know what else might need to be updated to work, but I did note that JINJA_EXTENSIONS should now be <code>JINJA_ENVIRONMENT = {'extensions': ['jinja2.ext.i18n']}</code>. Also, I was able to skip adding any submodules to my repo by keeping the default theme and using a different approach to sharing notebooks.</p>
<p>For notebook support, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pelican-jupyter/">the pelican-jupyter package</a> was easy to setup. I'm using "markup mode", which involves adding a few lines to the <code>pelicanconf.py</code> file, and I'm using metadata files to describe the notebook instead of putting that information in a cell inside the notebook.  </p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>The <code>pre-push.sh</code> didn't work how I thought it was meant to, so I changed it a little:
    - <code>pre-push.sh</code> to just <code>pre-push</code>
    - set as executable witn <code>chmod 766 .git/hooks/pre-push</code></p>
