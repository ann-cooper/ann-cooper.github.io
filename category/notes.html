</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I was inspired to finally start a blog after thinking of doing it for a few years by <a href="https://testandcode.com/191">this</a> episode in one of my favorite podcasts. One of the things that they discuss in that episode is that there are many reasons to have a blog (and many ways of blogging). My intention for this blog is to be a spot where I can keep notes about things I want to remember, useful tips &amp; tricks, and thinking about projects. </p>
<p>I used the project setup and static file publishing steps from <a href="https://justinnaldzin.github.io/create-a-website-using-github-pages-and-pelican.html">this Pelican tutorial</a>. I didn't use the theme section or the Jupyter Notebook section because neither worked quite right for me and I like the default theme. I didn't look into the theme support enough to know what else might need to be updated to work, but I did note that JINJA_EXTENSIONS should now be <code>JINJA_ENVIRONMENT = {'extensions': ['jinja2.ext.i18n']}</code>. Also, I was able to skip adding any submodules to my repo by keeping the default theme and using a different approach to sharing notebooks.</p>
<p>For notebook support, <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pelican-jupyter/">the pelican-jupyter package</a> was easy to setup. I'm using "markup mode", which involves adding a few lines to the <code>pelicanconf.py</code> file, and I'm using metadata files to describe the notebook instead of putting that information in a cell inside the notebook.  </p>                </article>
